                <p>
                    Firstly, we wanted to create an easy and cost-effective way for individuals and
                    small businesses to start their own online business irregardless of geographical
                    boundaries.</p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, we hope to reduce fraud between buyers and sellers using social methods
                    and information available on the internet.</p>

                    Ultimately, our goal is to help our customers manage and grow their online business
                    by improving business efficiency, increasing leads and helping them keep their customers
                    satisfied. To achieve our goals, we will use the latest technology available while

                <p>
                    We're a tiny company incorporated in beautiful New Zealand. Clear Pixels Limited
                    was started in January 2010.</p>
                <p>
                    We are what some would consider a microISV. But don’t let our size fool you. We
                    may be tiny but being small means we are more focused on individual needs and most
                    importantly, we listen.
